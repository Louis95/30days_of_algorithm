# 30days_of_algorithm

## Day 1:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Day 2

## Day 3
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output: 00111001011110000010100101000000
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 10111111111111111111111111111111
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
```

## Day 4


## Day 5
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

```
Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321
```

```
Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321
```

```
Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21
```

**Note:**
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

# Most Booked Hotel Room
Given a hotel which has 10 floors [0-9] and each floor has 26 rooms [A-Z]. You are given a sequence of rooms, where + suggests room is booked, - room is freed. You have to find which room is booked maximum number of times.

You may assume that the list describe a correct sequence of bookings in chronological order; that is, only free rooms can be booked and only booked rooms can be freeed. All rooms are initially free. Note that this does not mean that all rooms have to be free at the end. In case, 2 rooms have been booked the same number of times, return the lexographically smaller room.

You may assume:
- N (length of input) is an integer within the range [1, 600]
- each element of array A is a string consisting of three characters: "+" or "-"; a digit "0"-"9"; and uppercase English letter "A" - "Z"
- the sequence is correct. That is every booked room was previously free and every freed room was previously booked.

Example
```
Input: ["+1A", "+3E", "-1A", "+4F", "+1A", "-3E"]
Output: "1A"
Explanation: 1A as it has been booked 2 times.
```
